      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>MySlice is Syracuse University’s central online portal for managing academic, financial, and administrative tasks. It’s something that students, faculty, and staff use regularly for everything from enrolling in classes to checking financial aid and updating personal information. Despite its importance, the platform has several usability challenges that make it frustrating and inefficient to use. Students often struggle with navigating the portal because of redundant pathways, inconsistent page layouts, unclear feedback, and slow system performance during peak usage times. These issues not only slow down essential processes like course registration but also lead to mistakes and missed opportunities. Our project aims to address these problems by improving the overall user experience through a redesign that emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and consistency.</p>

      <p>The goal of our project is to redesign the MySlice student portal to improve usability, reduce frustration, and make key academic and employment-related tasks faster and easier to complete. We focused on three primary objectives: navigating the homepage, enrolling in classes, and managing student employment functions. These goals reflect essential tasks that students and student employees frequently engage with and often struggle to complete efficiently because of MySlice’s current navigation and design issues.</p>

      <p>Our target users are Syracuse University students and student employees since they interact with MySlice most frequently and because we have experienced these usability issues ourselves as students within these two groups. While MySlice serves a broader university population, our project focuses on improving the experience for these student-facing tasks, which are often time-sensitive and repetitive. To better understand their needs, we conducted a combination of individual interviews and a large-scale survey. This helped us uncover common frustrations like inconsistent navigation, unclear pathways to information, and difficulty completing tasks on mobile devices. Key features of our redesign include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A streamlined homepage with a customizable layout and clearly labeled sections</li>
        <li>Simplified class enrollment, consolidating multiple pathways into a single flow</li>
        <li>Improved employee management tools for accessing pay and timekeeping functions with fewer clicks</li>
        <li>A responsive design that works seamlessly across devices (desktop, laptop, and mobile)</li>
        <li>A back and home button on every page to help users recover from mistakes or confusion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By addressing these key areas and applying human-centered design principles, our project will make MySlice a more efficient and user-friendly platform for SU students.</p>
