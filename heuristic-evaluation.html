      <p>Below is our heuristic evaluation that was completed by team ImmiGo:</p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <img src="images/eval.png" alt="Heuristic Evaluation" class="responsive-img">
      </div>
      <p>Some heuristics that are violated are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>H3: No back button (2)</li>
        <li>H4: Add red warnings if input is incorrect in class search (2)</li>
        <li>H9: Error recovery not added yet, add error messages for classes not found, or when a user clicks the wrong path (2)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After revisions, here are the final high-fidelity prototypes:</p>
      <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video controls class="responsive-video">
          <source src="videos/class post.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
      </div>
      <p>In the first video, there are a couple of changes made:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Error prevention for when the user enters an incorrect class search value </li>
        <li>Back button to go back one step at any time </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another feature that we decided to incorporate was the option to check information about the class searched (like rate my professor) that provides you with details about previous professors, when the course is offered in the past, average class size, credits, and comments if any with a choice to be re-routed to another webpage if thereâ€™s too many reviews.</p>
      <p>This way, the university can filter any inappropriate comments but also help students to pick professors and get more information about the class before making a decision.</p>
    
      <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video controls class="responsive-video">

          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
      </div>
      <p>In the second video, there are also some changes made, mainly: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a back button to go back one step at any given time</li>
      </ul>
