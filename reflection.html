        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Working on this project gave us a much better understanding of what it really means to design with users in mind. We have learned about human-centered design in class, but this was our first time going through the full process ourselves and it made a huge difference. One of the biggest takeaways for us was how valuable it is to get feedback early, even when the design still feels unfinished. Talking to real students helped us stay grounded in the actual problems and made it easier to move away from ideas that sounded good in theory but did not really work in practice.</p>
    
        <p>Something that worked especially well was how we collaborated and stayed flexible throughout the process. Using Figma allowed us to make quick changes, and we communicated openly so everyone could contribute and stay on the same page. If we were to do it again, we would probably want to conduct more structured usability testing earlier in the process. Our heuristic evaluation was really helpful, but some of those insights would have been even better to have during the earlier stages of design.</p>
    
        <p>Overall, we are really proud of how our final prototype turned out. It makes key MySlice tasks like class registration and student employment management feel much more intuitive and less stressful. By focusing on feedback, clarity, and consistency, we were able to turn a pretty overwhelming interface into something that is much easier to use. It feels good knowing that our design decisions were shaped by real student needs from beginning to end.</p>
