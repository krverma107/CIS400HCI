      <h2>MySlice Redesigned</h2>
      <p>
        Our project focuses on redesigning Syracuse University’s student portal, MySlice, to improve its usability by making it more organized, concise, and intuitive to navigate. The primary goals are to streamline the portal’s navigation, reduce redundancy, and create a more consistent and user-friendly interface. These adjustments aim to address common pain points such as unclear feedback, low memorability, redundant paths, and performance slowdowns, which are particularly problematic during time-sensitive tasks like course registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our redesign is significant within the context of Human-Computer Interaction because it puts the user at the center of the design process. As students ourselves, we’ve felt the stress of trying to navigate MySlice during hectic times like class registration, only to get slowed down by confusing layouts or navigability issues. By focusing on HCI principles like clear feedback, intuitive navigation, and consistent design, we’re aiming to make MySlice easier and less frustrating to use. It is the central platform for managing everything from classes to financial aid, so improving its usability would really make a difference in students’ academic experience.
