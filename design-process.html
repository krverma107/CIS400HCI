      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We developed a research approach that combines both qualitative individual interviews with a quantitative large-scale survey. Using both of these methods allowed us to develop a nuanced understanding of user experiences while also collecting measurable data. The individual interviews provided detailed insights into specific pain points and user behaviors, allowing us to observe emotional responses and ask follow-up questions. The large-scale survey helped us identify patterns across the student population and quantify satisfaction levels with different aspects of the current system. Together, these methods provided both the depth and breadth of data needed to properly address our target users' needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interview sessions comprised of a 20-30 minute discussion focused on the student’s personal experiences with MySlice. We explored specific pain points by asking participants to recall recent frustrating experiences and describe their general impression of the platform. To understand navigation patterns, we presented participants with common scenarios such as enrolling in classes or submitting timesheets and asked them to walk through their typical process. We finished each interview with a discussion about what features participants would prioritize for improvement. For the survey, we wanted to have a minimum of 50 graduate and undergraduate participants. The survey was distributed through email lists, class announcements, and word of mouth to get the largest number of responses possible. It included sections measuring usage patterns, user satisfaction metrics (using 5-point scales for various aspects like navigation, visual design, and mobile responsiveness), and priority ranking potential improvements. The survey concluded with an open-ended feedback section encouraging participants to share specific experiences and suggestions.

        We’ve had a total of 57 survey participants. The following are some of the results:

      <h2>Storyboards</h2>
      <p>The three tasks that we designed storyboards for are: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Enroll in a class</li>
        <li>Clock In as a Student Employee</li>
        <li>Financial Navigation as a Student</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Jordan Taylor, a student at SU, checks their course requirements before registration and struggles to log in to the portal. They feel overwhelmed by the class options but manage to select courses that fit their schedule and degree requirements. After submitting their choices, they are unsure if they did it correctly and review their final schedule, still questioning their decisions.</p>

      <p>Alex Rivera, a student employee at SU, needs to login into MySlice and clock-in so they can log their hours. They feel frusterated because the path to the time clock is very long and they are unsure if they are doing it correctly. Finally, they have found the time clock but they are redirected to a glitchy website. They hit the clock in button but have a hard time knowing whether it was sucessful or not.</p>

      <p>Alex Rivera, a student at SU, receives a notification about a payment due and struggles to log in to the financial portal on both their laptop and mobile device. Once logged in on their phone, they find the portal confusing to navigate and are surprised by the bill amount. They attempt to locate contact information for help but face difficulties finding it.</p>
