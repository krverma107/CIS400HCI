      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We developed a research approach that combines both qualitative individual interviews with a quantitative large-scale survey. Using both of these methods allowed us to develop a nuanced understanding of user experiences while also collecting measurable data. The individual interviews provided detailed insights into specific pain points and user behaviors, allowing us to observe emotional responses and ask follow-up questions. The large-scale survey helped us identify patterns across the student population and quantify satisfaction levels with different aspects of the current system. Together, these methods provided both the depth and breadth of data needed to properly address our target users' needs.

      <p>
        The interview sessions comprised of a 20-30 minute discussion focused on the studentâ€™s personal experiences with MySlice. We explored specific pain points by asking participants to recall recent frustrating experiences and describe their general impression of the platform. To understand navigation patterns, we presented participants with common scenarios such as enrolling in classes or submitting timesheets and asked them to walk through their typical process. We finished each interview with a discussion about what features participants would prioritize for improvement. For the survey, we wanted to have a minimum of 50 graduate and undergraduate participants. The survey was distributed through email lists, class announcements, and word of mouth to get the largest number of responses possible. It included sections measuring usage patterns, user satisfaction metrics (using 5-point scales for various aspects like navigation, visual design, and mobile responsiveness), and priority ranking potential improvements. The survey concluded with an open-ended feedback section encouraging participants to share specific experiences and suggestions.
